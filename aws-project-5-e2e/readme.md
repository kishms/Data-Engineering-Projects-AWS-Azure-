# üî∑ AWS Medallion Architecture ‚Äì Financial Transactions Pipeline (Project 5)  
**Automated Incremental Data Processing + KPI Validation + Step Functions Orchestration**

---

## üìñ Overview  
This project is a **continuation of Project 4**, where we built a full Medallion Architecture pipeline for **financial transactions**, including local Kafka ingestion, S3 Bronze/Silver/Gold layers, AWS Lambda for KPI checks, AWS Glue transformations, and AWS DMS CDC replication.

In **Project 5**, we automate the pipeline using **AWS Step Functions**, ensuring that **once a new file is uploaded to S3**, it flows through the **Silver and Gold layers automatically**.  

Key highlights:

- Minimal human effort: only uploading files to S3 is required.  
- Lambda functions perform **KPI validation and reconciliation** on uploaded files.  
- Step Functions orchestrate **Glue jobs** for Silver and Gold layer processing.  
- SNS notifications are triggered post-processing for job completion alerts.  
- Incremental processing ensures only **new records** (based on `dms_id`) are pushed from Bronze ‚Üí Silver ‚Üí Gold.

## üìÇ Dataset  
**Financial Transactions Dataset (Kaggle)**  
- Contains both **old and new records**.  
- Primary key for incremental processing: `dms_id`.  
- Fields include:
  - `dms_id`
  - `amount`
  - `date`
  - `use_chip`
  - `zip`  

The pipeline **processes only incremental records** uploaded in fresh files. Historical data is assumed to be already present in Silver/Gold layers or stored as a DMS snapshot.

| Layer           | Service / Tool              | Purpose                                             |
|-----------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Ingestion       | Amazon S3                  | Bronze layer for fresh file uploads                |
| Trigger / KPI   | AWS Lambda + SNS           | Validates KPI and reconciliation automatically     |
| Orchestration   | AWS Step Functions         | Automates Silver ‚Üí Gold processing                 |
| Processing      | AWS Glue (PySpark)         | Data cleaning, normalization, dimensional modeling |
| Notification    | SNS                        | Alerts for successful job completion               |

## üîÑ Pipeline Workflow  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ File Upload ‚Üí S3 Bronze  
- Human uploads a **new CSV/Parquet file** containing fresh transactions.  
- **S3 Event Notification** triggers a Lambda function.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ KPI Validation & Reconciliation  
- Lambda function validates basic KPIs (row count, total amount) and reconciliation checks.  
- Alerts are sent via SNS if any validation fails.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Silver Layer ‚Äì Glue Transformations  
- Step Function triggers **Glue job for Silver layer**.  
- **Data cleansing and normalization** applied to incremental records.  
- Fresh incremental records are written to **S3 Silver**.  

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Gold Layer ‚Äì Dimensional Modeling  
- Step Function triggers **Glue job for Gold layer**.  
- Aggregations and star-schema dimensional modeling applied.  
- Incremental records pushed to **S3 Gold**.  
- **SNS notification** sent for job completion.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:**  
> The Glue scripts currently overwrite Silver/Gold layers in this demo, but the **intended behavior is to process only incremental data** based on the primary key `dms_id`. Historical data is assumed to be captured via **DMS snapshots** or previous pipeline runs.

## üìù Summary  

This project demonstrates **full automation of a Medallion Architecture pipeline** using **AWS Step Functions**, Glue, Lambda, and SNS.  

- Only **manual step**: uploading the file to S3 Bronze.  
- **Step Functions orchestrate the pipeline**, ensuring Silver and Gold transformations are applied automatically.  
- **KPI validation and reconciliation** ensure data quality.  
- **Incremental data processing** ensures that only new transactions are propagated downstream.

This completes the automated continuation of Project 4.
